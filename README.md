# FORM
The form with the list of fields is created with application of Cascading Style Sheets in it. The form also gets the data and on clicking the submit button stores the data to the local storage of the system. This downloading of the file is made possible by including the JavaScript. The onClick() function enables the storage of the file whereas the onSubmit() button enables the display message coneying thanks to the candidate for submitting the details.
